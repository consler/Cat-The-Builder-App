# Cat-The-Builder-App
App to build .apk from .catrobat

## How to use
App name, package name and version don't really matter YET, since it doesn't edit the manifest YET. Also, if you just try to run the app it will say package is invalid, so manual intervention through some apk tool is needed RIGHT NOW.
